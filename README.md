# Portfolio-Next

This is a brief regarding [my personal portfolio blog](https://nickabate.dev).  

Building a portfolio from scratch enabled me to practice creating a responsive mobile and desktop friendly design, prioritizing typography with a minimalist style.

Blog articles and works summaries are written in MDX, which seamlessly lets authors include JSX in their Markdown documents.
