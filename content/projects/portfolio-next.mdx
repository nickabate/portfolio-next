## What Is It

This portfolio utilizes the power of Next.js and static site generation, harnessing the power of MDX to convert Markdown to JSX for a seamless writing experience.

## Why Did I Build This

In an effort to gain proficiency with current frontend development tools and industry standards, I challenged myself to rebuild my online portfolio from scratch with new tech to build a more prominent online presence. Leveraging slick typography and minimalist styling, my aim is to let the writing and content speak for itself.

On my journey as a software engineer, creating a space to write gives me a creative outlet to express my current learning, thoughts and opinions on the world of technology and what stands out to me.

## What Tools Did I Use

Some of the tech used in this portfolio blog includes:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to create a speedy user experience utilizing static site generation.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility first styling throughout.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for strongly typing, better tooling and an improved developer experience.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to seamlessly integrate JSX into Markdown content.

## Lessons Learned 

To a nondesigner like myself, there is much more than meets the eye to create a captivating visual experience which heightens curiosity in the viewer, but also guides them throughout their journey on a piece of content. Building an online presence with the power of Next.js has also opened my eyes to different rendering methods and ways to optimize experiences on the web.
