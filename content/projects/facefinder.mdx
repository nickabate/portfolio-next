## What Is It

Face Finder utilizes a machine learning API to detect faces in online images, connecting to a user database with records in a PostgreSQL database through Node and Express. This project is optimized on desktop or tablet viewports.

## Why Did I Build This

This project was built as a part of pursuing my Complete Web Developer online certification with the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/). I wanted to challenge myself in building a deployed fullstack application from scratch, while utilizing third party resources and services.

## What Tools Did I Use

Some of the tech used in this app includes:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the frontend user interface. 
- A backend utilizing [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Knex](https://knexjs.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). 
- A machine learning [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/) to detect human faces.

With this project, machine learning results are analyzed in realtimne and presented to the user. The functionality of the API usage interacts with the cloud PostgreSQL database through a database ORM software to store a user's interactions with the application. There is also users stored in the database with create account and login functionality on the frontend.

## Lessons Learned 

Ensuring efficient database schema design while normalizing data is essential to an efficient project including CRUD operations. Best-practices were learned and followed with regards to utilizing a cloud database hosted on a cloud server with a connected frontend client facing application.
