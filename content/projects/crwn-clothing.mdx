## What Is It

CRWN Clothing is a modern e-commerce store which includes products and categories, user login with user cart functionality, and an integrated payment gateway. 

## Why Did I Build This

This project challenged me to take my knowledge in [React](https://reactjs.org/) to a new level. The project was built as part of pursuing my online certification as a React developer with the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/).

With this project, I learned how to use third party libraries to build efficient and modern experiences for users.

## What Tools Did I Use

Some of the tech used in this app includes:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store the product categories, products, and user accounts. 
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) has been used to manage centralized application state for things like a user's logged in status and the user's shopping cart. 
- [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/) has been integrated to simulate payments for a user's purchases.

## Lessons Learned 

Taking the time to thoroughly read different pieces of documentation is crucial to ensuring that a project will function as intended. Learning where to look while debugging errors was essential for this project's success, API integrations and live deployment.
